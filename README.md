# Image-Captioning-Bot

The aim is to caption newly feeded images.

1. Problem type :- Supervised 
2. Algorithms used :- LSTM
3. Dataset :- Flickr8K
4. Libraries used :- Keras, Numpy, PIL, NLTK, CV2, Matplotlib, Re
5. Files used :- Resnet50, Glove6B50D
5. Inspired by :- https://towardsdatascience.com/image-captioning-with-keras-teaching-computers-to-describe-pictures-c88a46a311b8

(In the project, model was trained on Google Colab but the code was written on local machine therefore have manually loaded .hdf5 model on local machine once it was trained on cloud)
